  abstract={When one figure is replaced with another that overlaps its spatial location, observers perceive an illusory, continuous shape change of the original object, a phenomenon known as transformational apparent motion (TAM). The current study investigated the extent to which TAM depends on a common, high-level shape representation that is independent of the shape-defining attribute. Specifically, we tested whether TAM is perceived similarly for both first- and second-order objects, defined by luminance and texture contrast, respectively. A compelling motion percept was observed in second-order TAM displays that was comparable to that seen in first-order TAM displays. Importantly, TAM for both stimulus classes showed the same pattern over a range of stimulus onset asynchronies. These results support the high-level shape account, indicating that TAM is driven by segmentation mechanisms that rely on high-level shape information rather than low-level visual characteristics.},

  title={A position anchor sinks the double-drift illusion},
  abstract={When the internal texture of a Gabor patch moves orthogonally to its envelope's motion, the perceived path, viewed in the periphery, shifts dramatically in position, and direction relative to the true path (the double-drift illusion). Here, we examine positional uncertainty as a critical factor underlying this illusory shift. We presented participants with an anchoring line at different distances from the drifting Gabor's physical path. Our results indicate that placing an anchor (a fixed line) close to the Gabor's path halved the magnitude of the illusion. This suppression was symmetrical for anchors placed on either side of the Gabor. In a second experiment, we used crowding to degrade the anchoring line's position information by embedding it in a set of parallel lines. In this case, despite the presence of the same lines that reduced the illusion when presented in isolation, the illusory shift was now largely restored. We suggest that the adjacent lines crowded each other, reducing their positional certainty, and thus their ability to anchor the location of the moving Gabor. These findings indicate that the positional uncertainty of the equiluminant Gabor patch is critical for the illusory position offset.},
